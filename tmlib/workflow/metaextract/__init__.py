'''Workflow step for extraction of microscope image metadata.

Microscopes typically write metadata about the image acquisition process into
the header of the generated image files. Unfortunately, almost every vendor
uses a custom file format. The `metaextract` step uses the
`Bio-Formats <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/bio-formats>`_
library to extract metadata from heterogeneous image file formats in form of
`OMEXML <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-xml/index.html>`_
according to the standardized
`OME <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/>`_ data model.
