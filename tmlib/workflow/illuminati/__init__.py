'''Workflow step for creation of pyramid images.

To achieve efficient zoomable visualization of terabyte-size microscopy image
dataasets accross multiple resolution levels, images need to be represented in
`pyramid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(image_processing)>` _ format.
To this end, the `illuminati` step casts images to 8-bit and tiles them up
according to available positional information.
Users further have the option to correct images for illumination artifacts and
align them between acquisitions based on pre-calculated statistics (if
available).
