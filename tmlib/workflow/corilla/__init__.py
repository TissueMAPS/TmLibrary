'''Workflow step for correction of illumination artifacts.

Microscopic images generally display inhomogeneous illumination. Correction of
these artifacts is important for visualization and even more so for
quantitative analysis of pixel intensities. To this end, the `corilla` step
calculated illumination statistics across all acquisition sites. These
statistics are stored and can later be applied to individual images to correct
them for illumination artifacts. The step further computes global intensity
statistics, which can be useful to uniformly rescale intensities across images.
