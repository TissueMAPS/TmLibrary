'''Workflow step for building and running image analysis pipelines.

The objective of image analysis is to identify meaningful objects (e.g. "cells")
in the images and extract features for the identified objects.
The `jterator` step provides users an interface to combine individual modules
available via the `JtModules repository <https://github.com/TissueMAPS/JtModules>`_
into custom image analysis *pipelines* in a
`CellProfiler <http://cellprofiler.org/>`_-like manner.
Outlines of segmented objects and extracted feature values can be stored for
further analyis or interactive visualization in the viewer.
