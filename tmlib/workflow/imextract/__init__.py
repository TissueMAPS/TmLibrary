'''Workflow step for extraction of pixel data from microscopy image files.

Microscopes usually store pixel data together with related acquisition metadata
in vendor-specific formats. Image files may contain more than one pixel plane.
Some microscopes even store all planes in a single file. This is not practical
and may even become a bottleneck depending on file access patterns and
implemented storage backend. These used file formates are also often not
understood by standard readers and generally not optimized for scalable storage
in a distributed computing environment. In addition, microscopes typically
store images uncompressed, while it is often desirable to apply compression to
reduce storage requirements. To meet these ends, the `imextract` step extracts
each pixel plane from microscope files and stores them in a consistent way,
which facilitate downstream processing.

Note that implementation details of the storage backend may be subject to
change and files may not necessarily be accessible via a POSIX compliant file
system! Users are therefore advised to use
:meth:`ChannelImageFile.get <tmlib.models.ChannelImageFile.get>`
to retrieve the extraced images.

Warning
-------
This step (at least temporarily) approximately doubles storage requirements,
because pixel data are extracted in parallel during the *run* phase,
but the microscope image files are only deleted afterwards during the
*collect* phase (and only if the 
:attr:`delete <tmlib.workflow.imextract.ImextractBatchArguments.delete>`
argument is set to ``True``).
